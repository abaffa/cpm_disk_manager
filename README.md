# CP/M Disk Manager
 
 Compatible with CP/M on breadboard by Grant Searle (http://searle.x10host.com/cpm/index.html)
 and RC2014 by Steve Cousins (https://rc2014.co.uk/)

This is a disk manager for CP/M disk format using a 64MB/128MB Compact Flash proposed by Grant Searle.

The emulator software is available at https://github.com/abaffa/z80cpm_emulator.

File data.dsk is an example of disk image.

To read the CFCard/SDCard it's necessary to run as administrator to have disk raw access priviledges.
